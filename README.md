# Attendance Automation and Analysis API

ATTENDENCE AUTOMATION and ANALYSIS is a REST Application Programming Interface (API) which helps in automation and analysis of Attendance with minimal user actions. It uses a Set of URLs with each having its own specified function to create, update and analyze the class attendance filtered with department, year and section. It uses JWT for authentication, SQL/ORM for handling database and JSON for data exchange. It is client independent and can integrate with any application that can make HTTP requests and can parse JSON data.
